* Have compile return a Stats record of timing etc
* In interactive mode, make the runtime system catch ^C and stop execution
* Type checker improvements:
  - allow generalization for local bindings
  - use subsumption (like if) in the arms of alternatives
  - instead of skolemization, use regular variables, making sure they are unique
* Redo type synonym expansion
  - Do expansion during unification
* Redo handling of synonym and instance tables.
  - These tables can persist during the compilation and only grow
* Implement two level tables for instances even in the tricky cases
* Removing [] from prim table
* Faster compression
* Use pointer reversal during marking, will be slower
* Fix bug uncovered by Data.Type.Equality
* mkQIdent
* Get rid of evalstring()
  - do everything in Haskell
  - make a low level primError that takes a utf8 string
* Better pretty print of Expr
* Allow top level pattern bindings
  - Merge EBind and EDef
* Implement pattern synonyms
* Implement qualified constraints
* Use capi, add value and field modifiers
* Ad hoc fix for f.g: check if g is a field
* Divide lib into different packages
* Sync lib with GHC base
* Handle closing of Handle properly (don't crash on multiple close)
  - implement ForeignPtr with finalizers for this.
* Use finalizers for alloca?
* Better naming of internal identifiers
* Add mask&co to exceptions
* Make deriving refer to identifiers that don't need to be in scope
* Add reductions for underapplied K2,K3,K4
* Move some Typeable instances from the class file to ST&co (makes it leaner)

Bugs:
* Missing IO in ccall shows wrong location
* Check for escaping skolemized variables
* Type checking Data.Data
* MonadFix (->)
* Install a targets.conf?
* let...in... doesn't parse correctly in a do
* let needs {} in a do with {}
* missing import in Text.Read.Internal gmhs: expandDict: Data.Floating.Floating
* export list in -boot doesn't work
* Cannot derive Show for 'newtype Alt f a = Alt (f a)'
* Fundep bug mtl:Control/Monad/RWS/Class.hs
